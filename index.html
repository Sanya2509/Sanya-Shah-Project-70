     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The cafeteria is an essential part of almost every kid‚Äôs school experience. The quality of the cafeteria often adds to the quality of life of each student, whether they care about the social aspect of it, the food, the atmosphere, and the length of time which they get to spend in said cafeteria. This is the place where students should be able to relax and have fun to recharge their energy which will help them to continue working hard throughout the day, which is why it is essential for every aspect of it to be up to par. Recently, it has been brought to  notice that the lunchroom has cracking foundations and broken floors. The School decided to renovate it, into something our students can feel happy to have lunch in. It's features are now : marble floors, stable walls, new lunchtables, and more.</p>
